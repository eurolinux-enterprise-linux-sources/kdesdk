Konqueror/dolphin service menus:
========================
Servicemenus for konqueror and dolphin have moved to services/ServiceMenus/.
To port kde3 servicemenus you need to:
-> change installation rule so that it installs to ${SERVICES_INSTALL_DIR}/ServiceMenus
-> add KonqPopupMenu/Plugin to the ServiceTypes line
See http://techbase.kde.org/index.php?title=Development/Tutorials/Creating_Konqueror_Service_Menus for more info.

"MimeTypes" desktop is not used now. Now we use official "MimeType" desktop entry (without "s")
(and separator is ";" )
